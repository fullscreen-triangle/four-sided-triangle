## How It Works

### 1. Request Processing with Fuzzy Evidence

```python
# Create fuzzy evidence system components
network_id = rust_integration.create_evidence_network()
optimizer_id = rust_integration.create_metacognitive_optimizer()

# Analyze request context using fuzzy logic
query_complexity = analyze_query_complexity(query)
resource_availability = assess_resource_availability(context)
quality_requirements = determine_quality_requirements(context)

# Update evidence network
evidence = {
    "value": query_complexity,
    "membership_degree": query_complexity,
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "source_reliability": 0.9,
    "temporal_decay": 1.0,
    "context_relevance": 1.0
}
rust_integration.update_node_evidence(network_id, "query_complexity", evidence)

# Propagate evidence and optimize
rust_integration.propagate_evidence(network_id, "belief_propagation")
optimization_result = rust_integration.optimize_pipeline(optimizer_id, context)
```

### 2. Strategy Selection and Optimization

The metacognitive optimizer:
1. **Analyzes Context** - Evaluates query complexity, resource constraints, quality requirements
2. **Updates Evidence Network** - Incorporates new evidence into Bayesian network
3. **Evaluates Strategies** - Scores available strategies using fuzzy inference
4. **Selects Optimal Strategies** - Chooses strategies based on expected outcomes and constraints
5. **Allocates Resources** - Optimally distributes resources among selected strategies
6. **Monitors Performance** - Tracks strategy effectiveness and learns from outcomes

### 3. Metacognitive Learning

The system continuously improves through:
- **Performance Tracking** - Records strategy outcomes and user feedback
- **Strategy Adaptation** - Updates strategy success rates based on performance
- **Context Learning** - Learns which strategies work best in different contexts
- **Uncertainty Reduction** - Reduces decision uncertainty through experience

## Integration with Four-Sided Triangle Pipeline
