# Frontend Overview

The Four-Sided Triangle frontend is a Next.js application that provides a sophisticated user interface for interacting with the multi-model optimization pipeline. Built with React and TypeScript, it offers an intuitive and responsive interface for domain-expert knowledge extraction.

## Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 13+**: React framework with app router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Hooks**: State management and side effects

## Key Components

### Query Component
Handles user input and query processing with advanced features:
- Syntax highlighting for technical terms
- Query validation and preprocessing
- Intent classification and context incorporation
- Real-time query analysis and feedback

### Modeler Component
Manages the transformation of queries into structured models:
- Entity extraction and relationship mapping
- Parameter identification and constraint recognition
- Domain knowledge integration
- Model validation and refinement

### Solver Component
Coordinates the problem-solving process:
- Solution strategy selection
- Multi-path reasoning visualization
- Evidence gathering and organization
- Uncertainty management

### Interpreter Component
Transforms technical results into user-friendly explanations:
- Technical translation and narrative construction
- Quality assessment and clarity enhancement
- Visual element integration
- Contextual adaptation

### Result Component
Displays comprehensive results with rich visualizations:
