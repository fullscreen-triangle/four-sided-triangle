# System Architecture

The Four Sided Triangle framework implements a sophisticated multi-modal processing system inspired by biological systems, particularly the glycolytic cycle. This document provides a detailed overview of the system's architecture and its components.

## High-Level Overview

The system is structured as a pipeline of specialized models, each handling specific aspects of information processing. The architecture consists of several key layers:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Modern web interface for user interaction
2. **API Layer**: RESTful interface for system communication
3. **Pipeline Layer**: Orchestrates the flow of information
4. **Model Layer**: Contains specialized AI models
5. **Storage Layer**: Manages data persistence and caching

## Component Details

### Frontend Layer

The frontend is built using modern web technologies:
- React.js for UI components
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI for component styling
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### API Layer

The REST API provides:
- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Response formatting
- Error handling
- Monitoring endpoints

### Pipeline Layer

The pipeline orchestrator:
- Manages the flow of information between models
- Handles error recovery and retries
- Provides monitoring and logging
- Implements caching strategies
- Manages resource allocation

### Model Layer

Specialized models include:
- **SciBert**: Scientific text understanding
- **BART-MNLI**: Natural language inference
- **Custom Models**: Domain-specific processing
- **Verification Models**: Output validation

### Storage Layer

Data management includes:
- Document storage
- Model cache
- Processing results
- System metrics
- User data

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Request validation
   - Data normalization
   - Format conversion

2. **Pipeline Processing**:
   - Model selection
   - Sequential processing
   - Parallel processing where applicable
   - Result aggregation

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Result formatting
   - Response validation
   - Client delivery

## System Integration

### Internal Communication

Components communicate through:
- REST API calls
- Message queues
- WebSocket connections
- Shared memory (where applicable)

### External Integration

The system can be integrated with:
- External APIs
- Database systems
- Message brokers
- Monitoring systems

## Security Architecture

Security measures include:
- API authentication
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Output validation
- Audit logging

## Deployment Architecture

The system supports:
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Cloud deployment
- On-premises installation

### Scaling Strategies

The architecture supports scaling through:
- Horizontal scaling of API servers
- Model parallelization
- Load balancing
- Caching layers

## Monitoring and Logging

The system implements:
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Request/response logging
- Model performance analytics

## Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- API endpoints
- Database settings

## Future Considerations

The architecture is designed to accommodate:
- New model integration
- Additional processing stages
- Enhanced monitoring
- Improved scaling capabilities
- Extended API functionality

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Container**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes

### Performance Characteristics

- Request latency targets

- Resource utilization
- Scaling limits
- Cache hit rates

## Development Guidelines

When extending the architecture:
1. Maintain modularity
2. Follow existing patterns
3. Document changes
4. Update tests
5. Consider backward compatibility
