# Four Sided Triangle

Welcome to the Four Sided Triangle documentation! This framework implements a sophisticated multi-model optimization pipeline for domain-expert knowledge extraction, utilizing a novel recursive optimization approach instead of traditional RAG architectures.

## System Overview

Four Sided Triangle employs a nested hierarchy of specialized models, treating each language model as a transformation function within a complex optimization space. The system is built around a metacognitive orchestrator that manages an 8-stage pipeline, ensuring robust and efficient processing of domain-expert queries.

## Key Features

- **Metacognitive Orchestration**: Central orchestration layer managing the entire pipeline
- **Modular Architecture**: Each pipeline stage operates as an independent module
- **Sophisticated Processing**: 8-stage pipeline for comprehensive query processing
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Configuration-driven pipeline that adapts to query complexity
- **Quality Optimization**: Advanced ensemble diversification and response optimization
- **Robust Integration**: Standardized interfaces between all components

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Query Processing**: Transforms ambiguous natural language queries into structured representations
2. **Semantic ATDB**: Performs semantic transformation and throttle detection
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Extracts and organizes domain-specific knowledge
4. **Parallel Reasoning**: Applies mathematical and logical reasoning
5. **Solution Generation**: Produces candidate solutions based on reasoning
6. **Response Scoring**: Evaluates solutions using sophisticated metrics
7. **Response Comparison**: Implements ensemble diversification techniques
8. **Threshold Verification**: Final verification against quality standards
