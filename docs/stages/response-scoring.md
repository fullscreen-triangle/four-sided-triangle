# Response Scoring Stage (Stage 5)

## Overview

The Response Scoring stage evaluates the quality of generated solutions using a Bayesian evaluation framework. This stage assesses multiple quality dimensions, quantifies uncertainty in the assessment, and determines whether refinement is needed.

## Components

### 1. Response Scoring Service

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire response scoring process by coordinating the Bayesian evaluator, quality dimension assessor, uncertainty quantifier, and refinement analyzer.

**Key Functions**:

- `process(prompt, context)`: Processes and evaluates the quality of a generated solution, returning a comprehensive assessment
- `refine(refinement_prompt, context, previous_output)`: Re-evaluates a solution after refinement, providing comparative metrics on improvement
- `_calculate_overall_score(quality_scores)`: Calculates the weighted overall quality score based on dimension weights

### 2. Bayesian Evaluator

**Purpose**: Implements a Bayesian framework for evaluating response quality by calculating posterior probabilities, likelihoods, and priors.

**Key Functions**:

- `evaluate(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Evaluates the solution using Bayesian probability framework
- `_calculate_prior_probability(solution, query_intent)`: Calculates P(R|Q) - prior probability of response given query
- `_calculate_likelihood(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Calculates P(D|R,Q) - likelihood of domain knowledge given response and query
- `_calculate_evidence_factor(domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Calculates P(D|Q) - evidence factor for normalization
- `_calculate_information_gain(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Measures information added beyond domain knowledge
- `_calculate_mutual_information(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Measures alignment between solution and query intent

### 3. Quality Dimension Assessor

**Purpose**: Assesses multiple quality dimensions of generated solutions including accuracy, completeness, consistency, relevance, and novelty.

**Key Functions**:

- `assess_dimensions(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent, bayesian_metrics)`: Assesses solution across all quality dimensions
- `_assess_accuracy(solution, domain_knowledge, bayesian_metrics)`: Evaluates factual correctness relative to domain knowledge
- `_assess_completeness(solution, domain_knowledge, query_intent)`: Measures coverage of required information
- `_assess_consistency(solution)`: Analyzes internal logical coherence and structure
- `_assess_relevance(solution, query_intent, bayesian_metrics)`: Measures alignment with user's query intent
- `_assess_novelty(solution, domain_knowledge)`: Evaluates presence of non-obvious insights
- `_fact_similarity(fact1, fact2)`: Calculates similarity between factual statements
- `_formula_similarity(formula1, formula2)`: Calculates similarity between mathematical formulas

### 4. Uncertainty Quantifier

**Purpose**: Quantifies uncertainty in quality assessment, providing confidence bounds and variance estimates for quality scores.

**Key Functions**:

- `quantify(solution, quality_scores, bayesian_metrics)`: Quantifies uncertainty in all quality dimensions
- `_quantify_dimension_uncertainty(dimension, score, solution, bayesian_metrics)`: Calculates uncertainty for a specific quality dimension
- `_calculate_confidence_margin(variance)`: Determines confidence interval margins based on variance
- `_calculate_overall_confidence(posterior_probability)`: Calculates overall confidence from Bayesian posterior
- `_estimate_solution_complexity(solution)`: Estimates complexity factor that affects uncertainty
- `_estimate_evidence_strength(dimension, solution, bayesian_metrics)`: Estimates evidence strength for each dimension
- `_calculate_average_interval(uncertainty_metrics)`: Calculates average width of confidence intervals
- `_find_highest_uncertainty(uncertainty_metrics)`: Identifies dimension with highest uncertainty

### 5. Refinement Analyzer

**Purpose**: Analyzes quality scores and uncertainty metrics to determine if refinement is needed and prioritize improvement areas.

**Key Functions**:

- `analyze(quality_scores, uncertainty_metrics, threshold)`: Analyzes scores to determine refinement needs
- `_analyze_dimensions(quality_scores, uncertainty_metrics)`: Analyzes each dimension against its threshold
- `_calculate_weighted_score(quality_scores)`: Calculates weighted quality score across dimensions
- `_prioritize_refinement(dimension_analysis, quality_scores, uncertainty_metrics)`: Prioritizes dimensions for refinement
- `_generate_suggestions(dimension_analysis, refinement_priority, quality_scores)`: Generates specific refinement suggestions
