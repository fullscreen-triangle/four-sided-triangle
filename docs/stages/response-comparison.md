# Response Comparison Stage (Stage 6)

## Overview

The Response Comparison stage implements ensemble diversification techniques to compare and combine multiple response candidates, creating an optimal integrated response that maximizes both quality and diversity. This stage follows the Response Scoring stage (Stage 5) and precedes the Threshold Verification stage (Stage 7).

## Components

### 1. Response Comparison Service

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire response comparison process by coordinating the ensemble diversifier, diversity calculator, quality-diversity optimizer, and response combiner.

**Key Functions**:

- `process(prompt, context)`: Processes and compares multiple response candidates, returning an optimized combined response
- `refine(refinement_prompt, context, previous_output)`: Refines a combined response based on feedback, tracking changes
- `_process_single_response(primary_response, evaluation_metrics)`: Processes a single response when no alternatives are available
- `_generate_alternative_responses(primary_response, context, max_alternatives)`: Generates alternative responses when none are provided
- `_track_refinement_changes(previous_output, refined_output)`: Tracks changes between previous and refined output

### 2. Ensemble Diversifier

**Purpose**: Implements ensemble diversification to create an optimal ensemble of response candidates, balancing between quality and diversity.

**Key Functions**:

- `diversify(primary_response, alternative_responses, diversity_scores, alpha)`: Creates a diversified ensemble of responses
- `_extract_quality_scores(primary_response, alternative_responses)`: Extracts quality scores for all candidates
- `_apply_greedy_diversification(candidates, quality_scores, diversity_scores, alpha)`: Applies greedy diversification algorithm
- `_apply_mmr_diversification(candidates, quality_scores, diversity_scores, alpha)`: Applies Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm

### 3. Diversity Calculator

**Purpose**: Computes pairwise diversity scores between response candidates, measuring how different they are across multiple dimensions.

**Key Functions**:

- `calculate_diversity(primary_response, alternative_responses)`: Calculates diversity metrics between response candidates
- `_calculate_content_diversity(response1, response2)`: Measures how different the actual content is
- `_calculate_structure_diversity(response1, response2)`: Measures how differently the content is organized
- `_calculate_emphasis_diversity(response1, response2)`: Measures how differently the responses emphasize information
- `_tokenize(text)`: Tokenizes text into words for comparison
- `_create_ngrams(tokens, n)`: Creates n-grams from tokens for content comparison
- `_calculate_type_distribution(elements)`: Calculates distribution of element types
- `_calculate_distribution_difference(dist1, dist2)`: Calculates difference between distributions

### 4. Quality-Diversity Optimizer

**Purpose**: Optimizes the balance between quality and diversity in the response ensemble using Pareto optimization.

**Key Functions**:

- `optimize(ensemble, evaluation_metrics, diversity_scores)`: Optimizes the quality-diversity trade-off
- `get_trade_off_metrics()`: Returns metrics from the last optimization
- `_extract_quality_scores(ensemble, evaluation_metrics)`: Extracts quality scores for candidates
- `_calculate_candidate_diversity(ensemble, pairwise_diversity)`: Calculates diversity score for each candidate
- `_identify_pareto_optimal(ensemble, quality_scores, diversity_scores)`: Identifies Pareto-optimal components
- `_select_optimal_elements(ensemble, pareto_optimal, quality_scores, diversity_scores)`: Selects optimal elements
- `_calculate_component_weights(ensemble, quality_scores, diversity_scores, pareto_optimal)`: Calculates weights for components
- `_extract_elements(response)`: Extracts and copies elements from a response

### 5. Response Combiner

**Purpose**: Combines optimized components from multiple response candidates into a coherent, integrated response.

**Key Functions**:

- `combine(optimized_components, primary_response, evaluation_metrics)`: Combines optimized components
- `_create_base_response(primary_response)`: Creates a base response structure from the primary response
- `_restructure_sections(optimized_elements, primary_sections, pareto_indices)`: Restructures elements into sections
- `_add_to_existing_sections(elements, sections)`: Adds elements to existing sections based on relevance
- `_create_new_section(elements, sections, title_prefix)`: Creates a new section for a group of elements
- `_calculate_section_match(element, section_info, section)`: Calculates element-section match scores
- `_ensure_unique_section_titles(sections)`: Ensures all section titles are unique
- `_count_components(elements)`: Counts elements from each source response

## Process Flow

   - Generate alternatives if needed
   - Prepare comparison context

2. **Diversity Calculation**

   - Apply diversification algorithm
   - Include primary response

4. **Quality-Diversity Optimization**
   - Find optimal trade-offs
   - Apply Pareto optimization
   - Select optimal components
   - Calculate weights

5. **Response Combination**
   - Integrate optimized components
   - Preserve response structure
   - Organize into sections
   - Ensure coherence

6. **Output Generation**
   - Combine all metrics
   - Calculate contribution ratios
   - Track component sources
   - Prepare final response

## Key Algorithms

### Greedy Diversification

The greedy algorithm iteratively selects candidates that maximize marginal contribution to the ensemble:

1. Start with the primary response
2. For each subsequent selection, choose the candidate that maximizes:
   
   `score = quality * alpha + average_diversity * (1 - alpha)`

### Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)

The MMR algorithm balances relevance and novelty in each selection:

1. Start with the primary response
2. For each subsequent selection, choose the candidate that maximizes:
   
   `MMR = quality * alpha - max_similarity * (1 - alpha)`

### Pareto Optimization

The Pareto optimization identifies candidates that are not dominated in quality-diversity space:

1. A candidate is Pareto-optimal if no other candidate is better in both quality and diversity
2. The primary response is always included in the Pareto-optimal set

## Configuration

The stage can be configured through various parameters:

```json
{
  "alpha_parameter": 0.7,
  "enable_alternative_generation": true,
  "max_alternatives": 5,
  "ensemble_diversifier": {
    "min_ensemble_size": 3,
    "max_ensemble_size": 7,
    "diversity_threshold": 0.3,
    "algorithm": "mmr"
  },
  "diversity_calculator": {
    "content_weight": 0.4,
    "structure_weight": 0.3,
    "emphasis_weight": 0.3
  },
  "quality_diversity_optimizer": {
    "quality_weight": 0.6,
    "diversity_weight": 0.4,
    "pareto_threshold": 0.05
  },
  "response_combiner": {
    "max_elements": 50,
    "max_sections": 10,
    "preserve_section_order": true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Ensemble Management**
   - Maintain diverse candidates
   - Balance quality-diversity
   - Track source contributions
   - Monitor ensemble size

2. **Quality Control**
   - Preserve primary content
   - Validate combinations
   - Check coherence
   - Ensure relevance

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache diversity scores
   - Optimize algorithms
   - Monitor processing time
   - Track resource usage

4. **Integration**
   - Maintain metadata
   - Support refinement
   - Track metrics
   - Document decisions

## Integration with Orchestrator

The Response Comparison stage implements the AbstractPipelineStage interface to seamlessly integrate with the metacognitive orchestrator:

- It exposes a standard process() method for comparison
- It supports a refine() method for re-evaluation after refinement
- It maintains metrics about its processing for monitoring
- It has a unique stage_id of "response_comparison"

## Example Usage

```python
# Extract the primary response and evaluation metrics from previous stages
primary_response = context.get("stage_outputs", {}).get("solution_generation", {})
evaluation_metrics = context.get("stage_outputs", {}).get("response_scoring", {})

# Perform response comparison
comparison_result = response_comparison_service.process(prompt, context)

# Access the combined response
combined_response = comparison_result.get("content", {})
primary_contribution = comparison_result.get("primary_contribution_ratio", 1.0)
diversity_metrics = comparison_result.get("diversity_metrics", {})

# Forward to threshold verification
verification_context = context.copy()
verification_context["stage_outputs"]["response_comparison"] = comparison_result
```
