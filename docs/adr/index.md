# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Four-Sided Triangle project. ADRs document the significant architectural decisions made during the development of the system, including the context, alternatives considered, and rationale for each decision.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help:

- **Document the rationale** behind architectural choices
- **Preserve knowledge** for future team members
- **Enable informed changes** by understanding past decisions
- **Improve accountability** in architectural choices

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

1. **Title**: A clear, descriptive title
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: The situation that motivates the decision
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision made
5. **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

### Foundation & Core Architecture

- **[ADR-0001: Module Naming Conventions](0001-module-naming-conventions.md)**
  - *Status*: Accepted
  - *Summary*: Establishes consistent naming conventions for modules and components

  - *Status*: Accepted  
  - *Summary*: Defines comprehensive error handling approach across the system

- **[ADR-0003: Dependency Injection](0003-dependency-injection.md)**
  - *Status*: Accepted
  - *Summary*: Implements dependency injection pattern for modularity and testability

### Pipeline Architecture

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **[ADR-0008: Distributed Computing Strategy](0008-distributed-computing-strategy.md)**
  - *Status*: Accepted
  - *Summary*: Scalable distributed computing with Ray and Dask integration

- **[ADR-0009: Configuration Management](0009-configuration-management.md)**
  - *Status*: Accepted
  - *Summary*: JSON-based configuration system for flexible deployment

## Contributing to ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR** following the established format
2. **Use the next sequential number** (e.g., ADR-0010)
3. **Include relevant stakeholders** in the review process
4. **Update this index** with a summary of the new ADR
5. **Reference related ADRs** where appropriate

## ADR Templates

### Basic ADR Template

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: ADR-XXXX - [Decision Title]
parent: Architecture Decision Records
---

# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
[Describe the problem or opportunity that this decision addresses]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision made]

## Alternatives Considered
[List other options that were considered and why they were rejected]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List positive outcomes]

### Negative  
- [List negative outcomes or trade-offs]

## Related ADRs
- [List related ADRs if any]

## References
- [External references or documentation]
```

## Historical Context

The Four-Sided Triangle project began with traditional RAG approaches but evolved into a sophisticated multi-model optimization pipeline. Key architectural evolution points:

1. **Initial RAG Implementation** → **Multi-Model Pipeline** (ADR-0004)
2. **Monolithic Architecture** → **Dependency Injection** (ADR-0003) 
3. **Simple Error Handling** → **Comprehensive Strategy** (ADR-0002)
4. **Basic Quality Checks** → **Bayesian Evaluation** (ADR-0006)
5. **Single Model Processing** → **Metacognitive Orchestration** (ADR-0007)

## Superseded Decisions

None currently. All active ADRs remain in effect.
