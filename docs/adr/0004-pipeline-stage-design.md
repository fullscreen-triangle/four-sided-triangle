# ADR-0004: Pipeline Stage Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Four-Sided Triangle system needed to overcome limitations of traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems when dealing with complex domain-expert knowledge extraction. Initial approaches using simple retrieval mechanisms proved insufficient for:

1. **Deep domain knowledge processing**: Complex specialized knowledge required sophisticated multi-step processing
2. **Quality consistency**: Single-stage processing led to inconsistent output quality
3. **Optimization complexity**: Real-world problems required multi-objective optimization beyond simple generation
4. **Context management**: Long reasoning chains overwhelmed simple architectures

A fundamental architectural decision was needed regarding how to structure the processing pipeline.

## Decision

Implement an **eight-stage specialized pipeline** with each stage having distinct responsibilities and specialized models:

### Stage Architecture

1. **Stage 0: Query Processor** - Transform natural language to structured representations
2. **Stage 1: Semantic ATDB** - Semantic transformation and throttle detection/bypass
3. **Stage 2: Domain Knowledge Extraction** - Extract and organize domain-specific knowledge
4. **Stage 3: Parallel Reasoning** - Apply mathematical and logical reasoning
5. **Stage 4: Solution Generation** - Produce candidate solutions from reasoning outputs
6. **Stage 5: Response Scoring** - Evaluate solutions using quality metrics
7. **Stage 6: Ensemble Diversification** - Create diverse, high-quality solution sets
8. **Stage 7: Threshold Verification** - Final verification against quality standards

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each stage has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Specialized Models**: Each stage uses models optimized for its specific task
- **Quality Gates**: Output quality is evaluated at each stage with refinement loops
- **Parallel Processing**: Stages can process multiple candidates in parallel where appropriate
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Each stage has fallback mechanisms and error recovery

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single-Stage End-to-End Processing
**Rejected** because:
- Insufficient quality control for complex queries
- No opportunity for specialized optimization at different processing phases
- Limited ability to handle multi-step reasoning
- Difficult to debug and improve specific processing aspects

### 2. Three-Stage Simple Pipeline (Input → Process → Output)
**Rejected** because:
- Too coarse-grained for complex knowledge extraction
- Insufficient specialization for different types of processing
- Limited quality assurance opportunities
- Poor separation of concerns

### 3. Microservices Architecture with Independent Services
**Rejected** because:
- Excessive complexity for coordinated processing
- Higher latency due to network communication
- More complex state management across services
- Harder to maintain consistency across pipeline stages

### 4. Dynamic Pipeline with Runtime Stage Selection
**Rejected** because:
- Increased complexity in orchestration logic
- Harder to optimize and predict performance
- More difficult to debug and maintain
- Limited benefits for the target use cases

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Specialized Processing**: Each stage can be optimized for its specific task
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple quality checkpoints throughout the pipeline
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to maintain
- **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific pipeline stages
- **Extensibility**: New stages can be added or existing stages modified independently
- **Performance Optimization**: Individual stages can be optimized separately
- **Model Flexibility**: Different models can be used for different stages based on their strengths
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple solution candidates can be processed simultaneously

### Negative

- **Increased Complexity**: More stages mean more components to manage
- **Latency**: Sequential processing through 8 stages increases total processing time
- **Resource Usage**: Multiple specialized models require more computational resources
- **Configuration Complexity**: Each stage requires its own configuration and tuning
- **Integration Overhead**: Ensuring smooth data flow between stages requires careful design

### Risk Mitigation

- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring at each stage to identify bottlenecks
- **Parallel Execution**: Where possible, stages process multiple candidates in parallel
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching strategies to reduce redundant processing
- **Timeout Management**: Each stage has configurable timeouts to prevent stalls
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Each stage has fallback options for when primary processing fails

## Implementation Details

### Stage Interface Standardization
All stages implement a common interface:
```python
class PipelineStage:
    def process(self, input_data: StageInput) -> StageOutput
    def validate_input(self, input_data: StageInput) -> bool
    def get_quality_metrics(self, output: StageOutput) -> QualityMetrics
```

### Quality Gate Implementation
Each stage output is evaluated against quality thresholds:
- **Completeness**: Does the output contain all required elements?
- **Consistency**: Is the output internally consistent?
- **Confidence**: How confident is the system in the output quality?
- **Compliance**: Does the output meet domain-specific requirements?
- **Correctness**: Is the output factually accurate?

### Refinement Loop Mechanism
When quality falls below thresholds:
1. Generate specialized refinement prompts
2. Re-process with additional context
3. Apply alternative processing strategies
4. Escalate to human review if needed
