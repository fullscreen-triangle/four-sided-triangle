# Frontend Development

This document outlines the development practices, guidelines, and improvement roadmap for the Four-Sided Triangle frontend application.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Yarn package manager
- TypeScript 4.9+
- Next.js 13+

### Setup
```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: 95%+ coverage for all components
- **ESLint**: Enforced code quality rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **JSDoc**: Comprehensive documentation for all functions

### Component Development
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Maintain clear component interfaces
- Document all props and state

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for component logic
- **Integration Tests**: React Testing Library
- **End-to-End Tests**: Cypress for critical workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI

## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

- Add visualization tools for complex data
- Enhance export and sharing capabilities

#### Key Tasks
- [ ] Domain expert model integration
- [ ] Multi-model comparison views
- [ ] Advanced data visualization tools
- [ ] Export functionality (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Social sharing capabilities

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
**Timeline: Weeks 19-24**

#### Goals
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Add caching mechanisms for frequent queries
- Optimize rendering performance
- Implement service workers for offline capabilities

#### Key Tasks
- [ ] Code splitting for major components
- [ ] Service worker implementation
- [ ] Request caching optimization
- [ ] Progressive Web App features
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Current Task Status

### UI Components
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- [ ] Dark mode theme with user toggle
- [ ] Skeleton loaders instead of spinners
- [ ] Error boundary components
- [ ] Toast notification system

### Query Interface
- [x] Syntax highlighting for technical terms
- [ ] Autocomplete for domain terminology
- [ ] Query history tracking
- [ ] Save/favorite functionality
- [ ] Export functionality for results

### Domain Expert Integration
- [ ] Visual selector for domain models
- [ ] Comparison view for model results
- [ ] Confidence score visualization
- [ ] Detailed metric tooltips
- [ ] Model feedback mechanism

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Code splitting implementation
- [ ] Service worker for offline capabilities
- [ ] Lazy loading for images (WebP format)
- [ ] Memoization for expensive calculations
- [ ] Request caching for frequent data

### Accessibility
- [ ] ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] WCAG AA color contrast compliance
- [ ] Accessibility documentation

## Component Architecture

### Design Patterns
- **Container/Presentational**: Separate logic from presentation
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic
- **Compound Components**: Related component groupings
- **Render Props**: Flexible component composition

### State Management
- **React Context**: Global state management
- **useState/useReducer**: Local component state
- **SWR**: Server state management and caching
- **Zustand**: Complex state management (when needed)

### Performance Patterns
- **React.memo**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo**: Expensive computation caching
- **useCallback**: Function reference stability
- **Lazy Loading**: Component and route splitting

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
yarn test

# Integration tests
yarn test:integration

# End-to-end tests
yarn test:e2e

# Performance tests
yarn test:performance
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Linting
yarn lint

# Type checking
yarn type-check

# Format checking
yarn format:check
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Bundle size monitoring
- Render performance analysis
- API response time tracking

## Deployment Strategy
