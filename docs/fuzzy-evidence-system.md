# Fuzzy Evidence System for Metacognitive Optimization

## Overview

The Fuzzy Evidence System is a sophisticated component of the Four-Sided Triangle framework that enables the metacognitive orchestrator to make optimal decisions by modeling requests as Bayesian evidence networks with fuzzy logic integration. This system provides a principled approach to handling uncertainty and optimizing decision-making in complex RAG scenarios.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Fuzzy Inference Engine** - Handles fuzzy logic operations and uncertainty quantification
2. **Bayesian Evidence Network** - Models causal relationships between system components
3. **Metacognitive Optimizer** - Uses the evidence network to optimize pipeline decisions
4. **Rust Integration Layer** - Provides high-performance implementations with Python fallbacks

## Fuzzy Logic System

### Fuzzy Sets

The system supports multiple membership function types:

- **Triangular**: Simple three-point membership functions
- **Trapezoidal**: Four-point membership functions with flat tops
- **Gaussian**: Bell-curve shaped membership functions
- **Sigmoid**: S-shaped membership functions
- **Custom**: User-defined point-based functions

```python
from app.core.rust_integration import rust_integration

# Create a fuzzy set for confidence levels
confidence_fuzzy_set = rust_integration.create_fuzzy_set(
    name="high_confidence",
    universe_min=0.0,
    universe_max=1.0,
    membership_function={
        "type": "triangular",
        "left": 0.5,
        "center": 1.0,
        "right": 1.0
    }
)
```

### Fuzzy Inference

The system uses Mamdani-style fuzzy inference with:

- **Antecedent evaluation**: Combines multiple conditions using T-norms
- **Rule activation**: Calculates rule firing strength
- **Consequent aggregation**: Combines outputs using S-norms
- **Defuzzification**: Converts fuzzy outputs to crisp values

```python
# Define fuzzy rules
rules = [
    {
        "conditions": [
            {"variable": "query_complexity", "fuzzy_set": "high", "operator": "is"}
        ],
        "output": {"variable": "processing_strategy", "value": 0.8},
        "weight": 1.0,
        "confidence": 0.9
    }
]

# Perform inference
result = rust_integration.fuzzy_inference(rules, fuzzy_sets, input_variables)
```

## Bayesian Evidence Network

### Network Structure

The evidence network models the RAG system as a directed graph where:

- **Nodes** represent system components, decisions, or states
- **Edges** represent causal or correlational relationships
- **Evidence** flows through the network to update beliefs

### Node Types

- **Query**: User queries and request characteristics
- **Context**: Contextual information and domain knowledge
- **Strategy**: Processing strategies and algorithms
- **Quality**: Quality metrics and assessments
- **Resource**: Resource availability and constraints
- **Output**: Final outputs and results
- **Meta**: Metacognitive control and monitoring

### Evidence Propagation

The system supports multiple propagation algorithms:

1. **Belief Propagation**: Exact inference for tree-structured networks
2. **Variational Bayes**: Approximate inference using variational approximation
3. **MCMC**: Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods
4. **Particle Filter**: Sequential Monte Carlo methods

```python
# Create evidence network
network_id = rust_integration.create_evidence_network()

# Add evidence to a node
evidence = {
    "value": 0.8,
    "membership_degree": 0.7,
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "source_reliability": 0.85,
    "temporal_decay": 1.0,
    "context_relevance": 0.95
}

rust_integration.update_node_evidence(network_id, "query_complexity", evidence)

# Propagate evidence through network
rust_integration.propagate_evidence(network_id, "belief_propagation")
```

## Metacognitive Optimizer

### Strategy Management

The optimizer maintains a portfolio of metacognitive strategies:

- **Query Optimization**: Adapt processing based on query complexity
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize resource usage across components
- **Quality Improvement**: Enhance output quality through strategy selection
- **Efficiency Boost**: Increase processing speed and throughput
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures and edge cases
- **Uncertainty Reduction**: Minimize decision uncertainty

### Decision Context

Each optimization decision considers:

```python
context = {
    "request_id": "req_12345",
    "query_complexity": 0.75,
    "available_resources": {"cpu": 0.8, "memory": 0.6, "time": 5.0},
    "quality_requirements": {"accuracy": 0.9, "completeness": 0.8},
    "time_constraints": 3.0,
    "uncertainty_tolerance": 0.2,
    "previous_performance": [...],
    "context_features": {...}
}
```

### Optimization Process

1. **Context Analysis**: Analyze current request context and constraints
2. **Evidence Update**: Update evidence network with context information
3. **Strategy Evaluation**: Evaluate available strategies using fuzzy inference
4. **Decision Making**: Select optimal strategies based on expected outcomes
5. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate resources to selected strategies
6. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks and uncertainties
7. **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor strategy execution and outcomes
8. **Learning Update**: Update strategy performance based on results

```python
# Create metacognitive optimizer
optimizer_id = rust_integration.create_metacognitive_optimizer()

# Optimize pipeline for current context
optimization_result = rust_integration.optimize_pipeline(optimizer_id, context)

print(f"Selected strategies: {optimization_result['selected_strategies']}")
print(f"Expected improvements: {optimization_result['expected_improvements']}")
print(f"Resource allocation: {optimization_result['resource_allocation']}")
```

## Integration with Four-Sided Triangle Pipeline

### Stage Integration

The fuzzy evidence system integrates with all pipeline stages:

1. **Stage 0 (Query Processing)**: Analyze query complexity and intent
2. **Stage 1 (Semantic ATDB)**: Optimize retrieval strategies
3. **Stage 2 (Domain Knowledge)**: Select knowledge extraction methods
4. **Stage 3 (Reasoning)**: Choose reasoning optimization techniques
5. **Stage 4 (Solution)**: Optimize solution generation approaches
6. **Stage 5 (Scoring)**: Select quality assessment methods
7. **Stage 6 (Comparison)**: Optimize response comparison strategies
8. **Stage 7 (Verification)**: Choose verification and finalization methods

### Orchestrator Enhancement

The metacognitive orchestrator uses the fuzzy evidence system to:

- **Predict Stage Performance**: Estimate how well each stage will perform
- **Optimize Stage Sequencing**: Determine optimal stage execution order
- **Resource Management**: Allocate computational resources efficiently
- **Quality Control**: Ensure output quality meets requirements
- **Adaptive Processing**: Adapt to changing conditions and requirements

## Performance Characteristics

### Rust Implementation Benefits

- **Memory Efficiency**: 50-70% reduction in memory usage
- **Concurrency**: Parallel processing of evidence propagation
- **Precision**: High-precision floating-point operations
- **Scalability**: Handles large networks with thousands of nodes

### Complexity Analysis

- **Fuzzy Inference**: O(R × C) where R = rules, C = conditions
